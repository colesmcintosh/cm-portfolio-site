        Why did I fall in love with programming? I was immediately fascinated by all of the possibilities it offers. I love the idea of creating something from nothing, and the challenge of making a program work the way I wanted it to. I also enjoy the problem-solving aspect of programming; it is like a puzzle that will make someone else's (or your own) life better. Nothing beats that for me.

        As I continued to learn more about programming, I became interested in artificial intelligence. I love the idea of creating intelligent machines that could think and learn like humans. The more I learned about AI, the more fascinated I became. The challenge of building machines that could think and learn is something that greatly interested me. I am constantly amazed by the possibilities and vast improvements that AI has shown to offer, especially in recent years.
